1) how to get rid of unwanted vertical space between blocks
   (figured out how to get rid of unwanted horizontal space between inline blocks)
   negative margin is horribly hacky
   font-size of 0 works but seems somewhat hacky

2) why do they use "hover" in the instructions? AFAICT, what you want is a 'mouseenter' event

   there is a hover pseudo-class, but I don't think that's relevant here:

3) Is there a better solution to persist state than global variables?
